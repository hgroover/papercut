PaperCut

This project was originally hosted elsewhere. The original code, last built
using Visual Studio 2005, can be found under mfc (master branch).

The intention is to rebuild the desktop app in a modular way using
Qt so that we have a:
* cross-platform gui
* command-line interface
* other interface(s) to be used as plugins with FreeCAD, Blender, etc.
