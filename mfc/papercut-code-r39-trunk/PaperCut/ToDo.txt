+ Use optimal rotation for each
+ Use half-assed fitting for pages
+ Add geodesic commands similar to Stellate
+ Add "shape modified" flag
+ Add check for modified doc (use MFC)
+ Add "Stellate" command in Shapes menu
+ SetRegistryKey( "HGSoft" ) in CWinApp
+ Store fixup references in CString for edge and vertex
+ Add recursive fixup to resolve symbolic references
+ No reparsing in CreateFromSymbolic2

Bugs:

- Cannot split tetrahedron - 2 pages each with 4 faces :-~
- Print rotated clips stellated tetrahedron off page

+ Stellating geodesic does not work - edge overlap
+ Stellating geodesic does not work - edge length mismatch
+ Network printing bug - nothing comes out!
+ Stellated figures ok, overlapping tabs not!
+ Add angle check in AutoJoin (too sharp for tabs)
+ Shapes menu missing from doc menu
