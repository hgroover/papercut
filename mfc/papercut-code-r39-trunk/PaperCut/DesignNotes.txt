       MICROSOFT FOUNDATION CLASS LIBRARY : PaperCut
========================================================================

Title:
PaperCut Design document v1.0 (way out of date)

Abstract:
This is a brief overview of the current design strategy for PaperCut.
Classes and their interactions are described in summary.

Introduction:
PaperCut is an application for creating layouts of paper models.

File format:
PaperCut reads and writes a native .shp file consisting of simple
textual definition statements.  It also imports other types of drawing
files (future).  The Shape file format is defined in ShapeFileFormat.txt

Dependent DLLs:
These should normally be present on any system -
  Debug			Release
  MFC42D.DLL	MFC42.DLL
  MFCN42D.DLL
  MFCO42D.DLL
  MSVCRTD.DLL	MSVCRT.DLL

Classes:

CPaperCutDoc
	Standard MFC CDocument derivative.  Contains public m_pShape and
	m_pShapeLayout, and wraps serialization.

CShape
	Logical representation of a shape.  Has multiple incestuous relationships
	with owned and managed objects CFace, CEdge, and CVertex

CFace
	A single face of a shape.  A shape may be a polyhedron (but not always).
	Calculation of inside angles is supported for triangular faces only.
	Connected to other faces via edges.  The outer surface of a face ("outer"
	being relative to the interior of a solid polyhedron) is visible.  Facing
	the outer edge, vertices are always counted clockwise.  This is crucial
	to the layout algorithm used.

CEdge
	A single edge of a face, participating in that face.  Two edges must
	always join to create a vertex - no dangling lines are supported!
	When two edges are joined "outwardly" this connects two faces.
	A layout may break these outward joins to create a net layout.  That's
	net as in "fisherman's net", meaning a planar diagram you'd get if
	you made cuts along the edges of a polyhedron so you could lay out
	the faces flat.

Help Support:

hlp\PaperCut.hpj
    This file is the Help Project file used by the Help compiler to create
    your application's Help file.

hlp\*.bmp
    These are bitmap files required by the standard Help file topics for
    Microsoft Foundation Class Library standard commands.

hlp\*.rtf
    This file contains the standard help topics for standard MFC
    commands and screen objects.



If your application uses MFC in a shared DLL, and your application is 
in a language other than the operating system's current language, you
will need to copy the corresponding localized resources MFC42XXX.DLL
from the Microsoft Visual C++ CD-ROM onto the system or system32 directory,
and rename it to be MFCLOC.DLL.  ("XXX" stands for the language abbreviation.
For example, MFC42DEU.DLL contains resources translated to German.)  If you
don't do this, some of the UI elements of your application will remain in the
language of the operating system.
