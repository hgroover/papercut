3d rotation and calculations

Given any two points x1,y1,z1 and x2,y2,z2 with the single-axis distances represented as
dx, dy, and dz
dx = abs(x1-x2)
dy = abs(y1-y2)
dz = abs(z1-z2)

the distance between the points is sqrt(dx*dx + dy*dy + dz*dz)

Rotation into a planar system involves eliminating one dimension.
This requires rotation on 2+ axes.

For a given triangle in 3-space --
1. Select one vertex v1 (with coordinates x1,y1,z1) as a pivot point
2. Select a second vertex v2 (with coordinates x2,y2,z2) as the endpoint of target segment s1
3. Rotate around the z-axis so that the x component of v2 is 0 with respect to pivot v1.
4. Rotate around the x-axis so that the z component of v2 is 0 with respect to pivot v1. 
   s1 is now perpendicular to both the x and z axes.
5. The remaining vertex is v3 (with coordinates x3,y3,z3). Rotate around the y-axis so that the
   z component of v3 is 0 with respect to pivot v1. The triangle described by v1,v2,v3 now lies
   entirely within the plane described by the x and y axes.
6. Apply the preceding three rotations to other points and test the z component with respect
   to pivot v1. If distance is 0, point is coplanar with v1, v2 and v3.
   
Point rotation --

Origin point is xo,yo,zo. For transformation they will be assigned (not necessarily in the same order)
to p1o, np2o, np3o. The target coordinates will be p1t, np2t, np3t. p1o == p1t is always true.

One of the three axes is the pivot axis pa. The coordinate corresponding to the pivot axis pa is p1o

Both coordinates np2o,np3o relative to the other two axes will be transformed.
One of the non-pivot coordinates, np2o, has a target value of 0. Therefore np2t==0.
The target coordinate p1t == p1o (as stated previously).

There is a point on the pivot axis pa where the axis measurement is p1o. Call this point papt.
The distance of the segment poa (from xo,yo,zo to papt) is sqrt(np2o*np2o + np3o*np3o)

Calculate the angle of rotation ar1 as follows.
If np2o is 0, ar1 = 0.
Otherwise, ar1 = asin(abs(np2o)/poa)
ar1 belongs to one of four quadrants based on the sign of np2o and np3o

np3o has an implicit rotation angle ar2 from the np2o axis. ar2 = atan(abs(np3o)/abs(np2o))
ar2 also belongs to one of four quadrants.

The combined angle of rotation ar3 = ar1 + ar2 modulo 90
ar3 belongs to one of four quadrants

Therefore, p1t = p1o
				   np2t = 0
				   np3t =
